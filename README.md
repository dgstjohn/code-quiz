A quiz of coding questions that tests the user's knowledge of basic JavaScript methods by soliciting the correct from a displayed list of four possible answers. The quiz penalizes wrong answers with a 10-second deduction from the countdown clock (set to 15 seconds per question), with a final score of either the time relaiming when all questions have been answered or 0 if the clock runs out before then. The user is then invited to enter his/her initials, which are captured and displayed in a high scores table, displayed in descending order, with the corresponding store.
